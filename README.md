### 🏡 Hi ! I'm Zaina, an Informatics Student @ UC Irvine :)

#### ⭐ As a recent Informatics major, I'm excited to begin my web-dev, design, and UI/UX journey through the ICSSC fellowship! My projects will showcase my myriad interests and diligent work ethic, so I hope you'll stick around to see more. 

#### 🐈‍⬛ I'm currently looking to focus on React, Unity, and various web-dev languages.
